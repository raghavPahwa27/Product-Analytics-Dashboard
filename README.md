# Product Analytics Dashboard with Customer Churn Prediction

> End-to-end product analytics and machine learning project built on the
> [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
> Designed for portfolio, technical interviews, and internship applications.

## Project Overview

This project answers real business questions a Product Manager or Business Analyst
faces every day:

- **Revenue** — Where is money coming from? Is it growing?
- **Customer Behaviour** — Who are our best customers? Who is at risk of churning?
- **Product Performance** — Which products and categories drive the most revenue?
- **Regional Performance** — Which states have the highest order volume?
- **Customer Satisfaction** — How do review scores correlate with churn?
- **Churn Prediction** — Which customers are unlikely to return?

The dashboard provides an interactive view of all of the above, backed by a
trained XGBoost churn model and AI-generated executive summaries via Gemini.

## Database Schema

The schema follows a **star schema** pattern with `orders` as the central fact table.

```
customers ──────── orders ─────────── order_items ──── products ── category_translation
                     │                     │
                   payments             sellers
                     │
                   reviews
                     │
                geolocation (via customers/sellers zip prefix)
```

See [`sql/schema.sql`](sql/schema.sql) for the full DDL.
